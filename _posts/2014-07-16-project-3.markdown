description: This short follows two children fleeing from soldiers through an old sewer. In an attempt to protect his friend, one of the children tries to draw one of the soldiers away. However, plans don't always work out as one would hope. This was the first animated production created using Synfig, and as such has become our “proof of concept” animation for it.
